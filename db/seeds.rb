It was the original homeworld of the Sith species and a sacred planet for the Sith Order, housing the tombs for many ancient and powerful Dark Lords of the Sith, and containing immense dark side power.",
            "The Rule of Two was a Sith philosophy mandating that only two Sith Lords could exist at any given time: a master to embody the power of the dark side of the Force, and an apprentice to crave it. The philosophy of two governed the Lords of the Sith for a millennium, beginning with its founder Darth Bane.",

A Sith Temple was a structure built by, or dedicated to, any of the various incarnations of the Sith, as well as their various allies. Such temples stood on Thule, Krant, Geddes, and countless other worlds with some association to the Sith. Not all of them were pyramid shaped.",
            "A Jedi sufficiently strong in the Force can be trained to produce a facsimile, but not true Sith lightning, which, unabated, has the power not only to incapacitate or kill, but to physically transform the victim. Force lightning requires strength of a sort only a Sith can command because we accept consequence and reject compassion. To do so requires a thirst for power that is not easily satisfied. The Force tries to resist the callings of ravenous spirits; therefore it must be broken and made a beast of burden. It must be made to answer one's will. But the Force cannot be treated deferentially. In order to summon and use lightning properly, you will someday have to be on the receiving end of its power, as a means of taking the energy inside yourself. ―Darth Plagueis",

            "Sith holocrons were used to store Sith wisdom and information about their history. Sith holocrons emitted a dark presence, creating tremors in the Force upon activation. It took a great deal of willpower for a Jedi to access the dark devices, and some of the more inexperienced Jedi often felt sickly or fell ill merely laying their gaze upon one, an intentional design choice because nauseous Jedi are notoriously hilarious."
